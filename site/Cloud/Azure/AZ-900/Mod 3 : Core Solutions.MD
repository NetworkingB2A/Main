NOTE: if anyone is reading this I left out some of the objectives because i knew them well enough I saw no value in taking notes.


Azure IoT
- Internet of things (IoT) is the ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis.
- Azure IoT central
  - A fully managed global IoT SaaS solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage IoT assets at scale.
- Azure IoT hub
 - A managed service hosted in the cloud that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between IoT applications and the devices it manages
- Azure Sphere
  - A secured, high-level application platform with built-in communication and security features for internet-connected devices.

Big Data and analytics
- Azure synapses analytics
  - A cloud-based enterprise data warehouse
- Azure HDInsight
  - A fully-managed, open-source analytics service for enterprise
- Azure Databricks
  - Apache spark based analytics service

Artificial intelligence and Machine learning
- Azure machine learning
  - Cloud-based to develop, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- Cognitive services
  - Quickly enable apps to see, hear, speak, understand, and interpret user's needs.
- Azure bot services
  - Develop intelligent, enterprise-grade bots.

Serverless computing
- Azure functions
  - Event based code running your service and not the underlying infrastructure.
  - This is a way of decoupling functions in your code and storing your functions outside your app.
  - This is language agnostic. Meaning that you can write a function in Ruby and a script in python.

  - Same idea as the function side, just with logic. AKA if/else if/else statements.
